# Prepacker

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to make a MERN fullstack app for use as a portfolio item. It will include authentication and web scraping.

Users should be able to login, upload gear data (manually or with the scraper), and create prepacker lists that will help them plan what to bring on a trip. This is mainly aimed at backpackers, but could be used for any trip, or simply to keep track of what items you own.

There will be two main pages: the closet and the prepacker. On the closet page, users will be able to see all the equipment they have uploaded with more detail compared to the prepacker page. The prepacker page will be for creating lists for items to pack on a trip. Users will be able to save these lists for future use. Both pages will allow the user to upload new gear.
